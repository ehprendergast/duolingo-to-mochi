# duolingo-to-mochi

This tool helps you turn screenshots of Duolingo sentences with new vocabulary into Mochi flashcards with cloze deletions. That way you can review new words you learn on Duolingo with spaced repetition, on your own time and at your own pace. This tool was created free to use by Eric Prendergast, and its source code can be found at his GitHub.
